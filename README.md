# PHY407
Small selection of homework from PHY407, a computing methods in physics and data science course.
Chose ones I believe are useful/neat/good. No outputs, but they all run easily/quickly.

**AudioFilter:** Routines for filtering wave audio files using Fourier transform methods. An example is shown with the file GraviteaTime and GraviteaTime_Filtered

**Deconvolution:** Sharpens images by doing deconvultions with Fourier transforms.

**GaussSeidel:** Caculates a partial differential equation using the Gauss-Seidel relaxation method.

**Gradient:** Evaluates gradient map on images.

**IdealGas:** Simulates non-interacting quantum ideal gas using Monte Carlo methods. Evolves internal energy and Boltzmann Distribution of particle energies.

**Integrator:** Integrates a function numerically using trapezoidal method, simpson's rule, and gaussian quadrature. Compares accuracy of the three.

**MonteCarloDLA:** A Monte Carlo method to simulate diffusion-limited aggregation, the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates.

**RandWalk:** Simulates a random walk. Go figure.

**SolveLinear:** Solves a system of linear equations.
